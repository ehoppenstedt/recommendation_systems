# recommendation_systems
Recommendation systems based on probabilistic modeling and standard machine learning approaches.

The first notebook uses a KNN approach to create learning paths based on how users grouped courses.
My inspiration was Spotify. Apparently, Spotify suggests what song should go next based on how users group them in their own learning paths.
I have a dataset that contains courses grouped in learning paths by users, to I created a simple recommendation system trained on the user's learning paths.

The model is overly simplistic but works as an initial exercise on how to build a recommendation system.
